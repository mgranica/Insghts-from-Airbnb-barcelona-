## Summary of Findings


- Airbnb's business model focuses on entires homes and private rooms
- The price curve is completely right skewed. The majority of their prices are between â‚¬ 50 100 per night.
- Prices linetime: there is a seasonality in the variation of prices, weekends have an average higher value and public events such as sonnar or mobile world congress coincide with a rise in prices.
- The neighborhoods with the most expensive price per night are Eixample and Sarria.
Sarria is a traditional neighborhood of the city with a residential character that mostly houses houses with high purchasing power. The Eixample is the most typical neighborhood in Barcelona that transmits the true experience of visiting the city and this can be seen reflected in the number of reviews in this neighborhood, more than 50% of the total.
- Hosts with more than 100 listings under their control exert a very strong pressure on the rental housing market, and on average their prices are 10% higher. Obviously, micro-businesses have emerged around this platform that has very attractive results.
